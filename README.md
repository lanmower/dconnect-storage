```cleos push action <contract name> edit '[ "<user name>","<primary key>" ]' -p <user name>@active```
# EDIT - modify an entry

You can read items either from global scope, or scoped to the user as follows
```cleos -u https://dconnect.live get table <contract name> <contract name> post```

You can also read items from user scope (look at this as the users profile)
```cleos -u https://dconnect.live get table <contract name> <user name> post```
